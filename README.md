> A new code base to Anilist bot in Telegram.

## About
This bot helps you to send info in your [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) chats about:
* Animes
* Mangas
* Characters
* Studios
* Staffs
* etc

More than this it also notifies you when new episodes are released and lets you have a:
* Watchlist
* Readlist
* Countdown from new episodes
* Time watching anime calculator
* Anime and manga filters in your lists by: airing/publishing, completed, cancelled & soon
* News when released from [ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/) about your mangas and animes
* And much more features that are under development

All of the data about it is fetched from [Anilist](http://anilist.co/) & [Anichart](http://anichart.net/).

## Disclaimer
1. [JoshStar](https://github.com/joshstar) was kind to [allow](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs/issues/50#event-1794658906) me to store the translated info about the content in different languages, improving the user experience;
2. This project is a new implementation, the old code base is [here](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/Anilist-bot);
3. Also, I've removed the _command_ option when talking to the to the bot from the old version due to low usage.

## Supported languages:
By default all the commands are in English, but you can see if the same command is available in your language. Only English and Portuguese had some kind of review, the others are automatic translation from [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/).

* [Arabic](./others/locales/ar.yaml)
* [Chinese](./others/locales/zh.yaml)
* [Dutch](./others/locales/nl.yaml)
* [English](./others/locales/en.yaml)
* [French](./others/locales/fr.yaml)
* [German](./others/locales/de.yaml)
* [Indonesian](./others/locales/id.yaml)
* [Italian](./others/locales/it.yaml)
* [Japanese](./others/locales/jp.yaml)
* [Portuguese - Brazil](./others/locales/pt.yaml)
* [Russian](./others/locales/ru.yaml)
* [Spanish](./others/locales/es.yaml)

# Supporting

Right now, this project has the following total lines of code (loc):

![Lines](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=LOC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FFazendaaa%2FAnilistBot%2Fmaster%2Fstats.json&query=%24.SUM.code&colorB=red)

And this bot uses four paid services:
1. [Heroku](http://heroku.com/)
2. [Heroku Redis](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-redis)
3. [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
4. [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)

All of your support actually makes a difference to help me maintain this project up and running. I really would love if anyone who uses it could support it helping one time with any value that think it worth it or even supporting it each month with one dollar through my Patreon. And this would allow me to improve this project more and more, adding a ton of features that I've planned.

You don't think that money is the best option to help out? It's okay, I'm open to translations request and code also! Just take a look at [Contributing](#contributing).

Also, I explain better the _"Why"_ receive donations instead of selling ads at [SUPPORT.md](./docs/support/SUPPORT.md).

Consider buy me a coffee:

[![Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/custom_images/orange_img.png)](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Fazenda)

Or even becoming a patron:

# Contributing
Please, I'm not a native/fluent english speaker, so whether you see a variable name wrote the wrong way or even some comment where I've wrote something with the wrong "past perfect way of life" or something like that, please let me know it. Not always is just about the code, but rather making it more clear to other people to learn from it.

So, whether is code or not you can help me out making this code more accessible or even supporting trough a new language or fixing some mistranslated content. Just read the [CONTRIBUTING.md](./docs/contributing/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# TODO
Since I will be keeping this README up to date with any major change and I don't use any versioning system to log all the fixed bugs or previous projects updates, you can still have a taste of what comes next and what is being under analysis right in the [Projects](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/AnilistBot/projects/) tab. But I can give you a taste what I have in mind:

* Caching most requested requisitions
* Improve metric in time watching Anime:
    * Provide to user options to _"what to do"_ in real life what he likes. Like showing a [YouTube](https://youtube.com/) drawing channel if the users likes [Bakuman](https://anilist.co/anime/7674/Bakuman/) as one example
* Add a pattern matching like _"Did you mean?"_ of Google. Probably I will use it [didyoumean](https://www.npmjs.com/package/didyoumean) package
* Anilist connection
* Anime/manga review
* Support to anime/manga news besides ANN -- to improve news accessibility
* Natural Language Processing -- You can really have a talk to this bot
* Anime and Manga recommendation -- Create a engine to it:
    * Create another server to store this processing -- Talking to the bot through an GraphQL API and probably using [Rust](http://rust-lang.org/) to processing this info and [GO](https://golang.org/) to handle the API
    * Probably uses a server that allows GPU usage
    * Improve this engine through image, video and audio processing
* Create a site displaying info about:
    * Trending animes/mangas
    * A graph showing anime/mangas distances between users likes
* The site must be a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps) to allow new users besides the Telegram user base

# Deployment
This bot is up and running at [Heroku](http://heroku.com/) in a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container. You can also deploy yourself this bot into Heroku through:

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/Dank-del/AnilistBot)

But if you use [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/):

[![Deploy to Azure](https://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/?repository=https://github.com/Fazendaaa/AnilistBot/tree/master)

Or even deploy it in [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/):

[![Deploy to Docker Cloud](https://files.cloud.docker.com/images/deploy-to-dockercloud.svg)](https://cloud.docker.com/stack/deploy/?repo=https://github.com/Fazendaaa/AnilistBot/tree/master)

> Note: You must be logged in to Docker Cloud for the button to work. Otherwise, the link results in a 404 error.

# Versioning
I would love to say that [SemVer](https://semver.org/) or anything like that is used but, in my personal experience, this kind of approach doesn't work very well with me, the guy who could be committing in this project for two weeks in a roll and leave it for almost one year with no simple ```npm update```... No versioning system is used. 

# How does it work?
You can build yourself a bot similar to this one, I've wrote a tutorial about it in my [Podesearch Bot](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot) just follow the procedures listed in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/podsearch_bot/blob/master/docs/building/BUILDING.md).

# Code
Plain and simple [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/) and the [Microsoft linter standards](https://github.com/Microsoft/tslint-microsoft-contrib) for it.

## Webpack
> _"JUST WHY???"_ -- everybody

As the [Anilist API V2](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs) was written with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), as I was using it, the needed queries as JS ```imports``` was a option but only with [Webpack](http://webpack.js.org/) and the [webpack-graphql-loader](https://github.com/samsarahq/graphql-loader). And since this makes the code more cleaner and easier to maintain that's why it was used; that's the GREAT difference and could seen a little bit off to see this kind of decision and that's the answer.

## Build with
* [city-timezones](https://github.com/kevinroberts/city-timezones)
* [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv)
* [endeavor](https://github.com/Fazendaaa/endeavor)
* [emoji-regex](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/emoji-regex)
* [google-translate](https://github.com/Localize/node-google-translate)
* [moment](https://github.com/moment/momentjs.com)
* [moment-timezone](https://github.com/moment/moment-timezone)
* [mongoose](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose)
* [node-google-timezone](https://github.com/ecteodoro/node-google-timezone)
* [node schedule](https://github.com/node-schedule/node-schedule)
* [striptags](https://github.com/ericnorris/striptags)
* [telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf)
* [telegraf-i18n](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf-i18n)
* [telegraf-session-redis](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf-session-redis)

## Testing
Since there's a [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/) integration and [Codecov](https://codecov.io/). All of the tests were written with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) with the help of [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest).

To run all tests just:

```bash
npm test
```

If you ran into some errors related to package dependencies and want to know how to handle it, read the [Security](##security) info.

### Unneeded Code
There's a pattern to do testing based on using JSON files describing the tests to be done. That being said, the [```doTesting```](./ci/doTesting.ts) function has a unneeded argument, the name of the function to be tested.

Node runs using [V8](https://github.com/v8/v8) engine, but since this project uses TS, the compiled code doesn't have the _name_ property in the anonymous function. The problem is a [known issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6433); the folks at [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/6824#event-1787524124) and [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/677#issuecomment-412893575) helped a lot to understand this -- once this issue is fixed there won't be this anymore.

## Security
I've added a integration with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to ensure the Continuos Development (CD).

### Errors/Bugs in Dependencies
When Snyk report some errors or bugs that can be fixed, just follow the CLI command to fix them before running -- more info at their [docs](https://github.com/snyk/snyk#cli).
